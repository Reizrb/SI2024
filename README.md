# Leveraging Geospatial Data and Machine Learning to Predict Insurance-derived Flood Damage Cost

"The Summer Institute is a partnership between CUAHSI and NOAA that aims to engage the academic community in research to advance the mission of the National Water Center. Summer Institute participants work on projects related to water prediction and flood forecasting. Students work in small teams and are mentored by university faculty and other professionals" CUAHSI.org.
